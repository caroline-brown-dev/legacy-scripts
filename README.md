# Legacy Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **legacy-scripts** repository. This is where all the random, outdated, and completely unmaintained scripts go to rest.  

**Disclaimer:**  
- These scripts are likely broken.  
- They probably won't work without tweaking.  
- Use at your own risk. Seriously.  

## What's Inside?
- Random Python scripts for data manipulation.  
- A few bash scripts (I think).  
- Some mysterious `.txt` files.  
- At least one file with comments like "TODO: fix this eventually".

### Warning ⚠️
If you're looking for something *important*, you're in the wrong place.

## Files
- **cleanup.sh**: Deletes stuff. Sometimes too much.  
- **parse_data.py**: Parses data, but only specific types (no idea which ones).  
- **README.md**: You’re reading it now. Congrats!  
- **config_backup.txt**: Contains random old configurations.
